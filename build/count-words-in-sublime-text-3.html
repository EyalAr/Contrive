		<p>I am using plain text editors, such as Sublime Text and Vim, not only for
writing code, but also for other types of documents, such as blog posts. In Vim
it&#39;s easy to get the word count, but in ST I did not find such a built-in
option. What I wanted was simple - whenever I select a text I want to have the
number of words in the selection written in the status bar.</p>
<p>Trying to find a solution in Google yields such a plug-in for ST2. For ST3 I was
not able to find anything satisfactory. Granted, maybe I didn&#39;t look hard
enough; but I needed something simple, and I thought it would be a good
opportunity to look into ST&#39;s plug-ins API. Unlike Vim, which has its own
scripting language, ST uses Python.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/plugins.html">documentation</a> is not very extensive, but the <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/api_reference.html">Python API</a> provides
basic explanations (It would be nice to see more examples and thorough
explanations).</p>
<p>In order to create a plug-in we have to extend one of the classes in the
<code>sublime_plugin</code> module. Each class provides functionalities for a different
kind of plug-in. In our case we will be extending the <code>EventListener</code> class. We
will be counting the words inside the selected regions on any event of selection
change.</p>
<p>At first I approached the problem by obtaining the selected text in the current
view and, using a regex, finding the number of words in the text. The regex I
used was <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_][\s,\.;:#\(\)-\?!]+(?=([a-zA-Z0-9_]))</code>, which matches any
string that represents a separation between words. Such a string is composed of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any one letter or number: <code>[a-zA-Z0-9_]</code></li>
<li>Any combination of white spaces and punctuation marks: <code>[\s,\.;:#\(\)-\?!]+</code></li>
<li>Any one letter or number: <code>(?=([a-zA-Z0-9_]))</code></li>
</ol>
<p>The last part matches any letter or number, but does not consume it (just a
lookahead), so that in case of one letter words we do not miss any match.</p>
<p>This approached worked, but then I noticed that the API provides a <code>classify</code>
method in the <code>View</code> class, which allows to get a classification for a point in
the text. This made things easier, because it means ST already detects when a
new word starts for us. And indeed one of the classifications this method
returns is <code>CLASS_WORD_START</code>.</p>
<p>So all we need to do now is iterate over all the characters in the selection and
count how many of them are a start of a new word:</p>
<pre><code><span class="hljs-comment">#!python</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> sublime, sublime_plugin, re

<span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">CountWordsInSelectionCommand</span><span class="hljs-params">(sublime_plugin.EventListener)</span>:</span>

        <span class="hljs-string">'''
        listen to event 'on_selection_modified' and count words in all

        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> len(view.sel()) == <span class="hljs-number">1</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">and</span> view.sel()[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>].size() == <span class="hljs-number">0</span>:
            view.set_status(<span class="hljs-string">"words_in_selection"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">""</span>)
            <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span>

        count = <span class="hljs-number">0</span>
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> region <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> view.sel():
            <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> range(region.begin(), region.end()):
                <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> view.classify(i) &amp; sublime.CLASS_WORD_START:
                    count += <span class="hljs-number">1</span>

        view.set_status(<span class="hljs-string">"words_in_selection"</span>, <span class="hljs-string">"{} words"</span>.format(count))
</code></pre><p>The code can also be downloaded from <a href="https://gist.github.com/EyalAr/8383050">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>To install the plug-in just put the file in the <code>Packages/User</code> directory. In
Linux the full path is <code>~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages/User</code>.</p>
